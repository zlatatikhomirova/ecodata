# EcoData
We are developing an intelligent system (EcoData) for automating research on plant bioindicators. The system helps automate measurements, research, and data processing that are necessary to assess the environmental condition of an area using the fluctuating asymmetry method.

We have divided the project into three parts. The first is system design, ML part and data research. The second part is backend development, the third is frontend development. In this repository you can find system design, ML part and data research. Links to the repositories for backend and frontend are below.
